#### URL Types

* **Relative URLS** must match the format of a URL path, relative to the document root, for example `/about` or `/categories/new#first`.
* **Absolute URLS** must match a full absolute url, prefixed with protocol and containing a domain name, for example `https://www.example.com/` or `https://example.com/about`.
* **Mailto Protocol** must be an email address prefixed by `mailto:`.
* **Tel Protocol** must be a phone number prefixed by `tel:`.

### Templating with an Advanced URL Field

In a Twig template, the field is rendered directly, without any other additional inner properties. See the following example, where `myURL` is an Advanced URL field on the entry:

```twig
<a href="{{ entry.myURL }}">My Link</a>
```
